Hello!  

I'm a full stack engineer with experince primarily around B2B tools and big data.  
I've been coding professionally since 2020, and studied Data Analytics + Computer Science in college before that.  

My foundation is in OO languages like Java & JavaScript, with some dabbling in bash/CLI.  
I've thoroughly enjoyed learning Elixir over the past few years and find the functional syntax very useful & clean.
